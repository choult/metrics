# Metrics demo

## Docker

In order to run the environment, you need to install Docker and Docker Compose:

 * [Download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
   * [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package)
 * [Download and install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then you can run the `make server` command and the Makefile will do the rest.
